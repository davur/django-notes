django-notes
============

A simple notes project with multiple future extension possibilities.

The plan is to branch off and experiment with some of the below ideas in no particular order:

- Heroku deployment
- Row/object level permissions
- Single page app with REST and Javascript
- Experiment with tagging Django apps
- Experiment with Django filtering apps
- Task/ticketing extensions
- Automatic audit trail/versioning 
- New relic setup (on heroku)
- Sentry setup
